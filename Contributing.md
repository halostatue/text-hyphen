# Contributing

I value any contribution to text-hyphen you can provide: a bug report, a feature
request, or code contributions.

There are a few guidelines for contributing to text-hyphen:

- Code changes _will_ _not_ be accepted without tests. The test suite is
  written with test/unit and will be eventually moved to [minitest][].
- Match my coding style.
- Use a thoughtfully-named topic branch that contains your change. Rebase your
  commits into logical chunks as necessary.
- Use [quality commit messages][].
- Do not change the version number; when your patch is accepted and a release
  is made, the version will be updated at that point.
- Submit a GitHub pull request with your changes.
- New or changed behaviours require new or updated documentation.

### Test Dependencies

text-hyphen uses Ryan Davisâ€™s [Hoe][] to manage the release process, and it adds
a number of rake tasks. You will mostly be interested in `rake`, which runs the
tests the same way that `rake test` will do.

To assist with the installation of the development dependencies for text-hyphen,
I have provided the simplest possible Gemfile pointing to the (generated)
`text-hyphen.gemspec` file. This will permit you to do `bundle install` to get
the development dependencies. If you already have `hoe` installed, you can
accomplish the same thing with `rake newb`.

This task will install any missing dependencies, run the tests/specs, and
generate the RDoc.

You can run tests with code coverage analysis by running `rake test:coverage`.

## Workflow

Here's the most direct way to get your work merged into the project:

- Fork the project.
- Clone down your fork (`git clone git://github.com/<username>/text-hyphen.git`).
- Create a topic branch to contain your change (`git checkout -b my_awesome_feature`).
- Hack away, add tests. Not necessarily in that order.
- Make sure everything still passes by running `rake`.
- If necessary, rebase your commits into logical chunks, without errors.
- Push the branch up (`git push origin my_awesome_feature`).
- Create a pull request against halostatue/text-hyphen and describe what
  your change does and the why you think it should be merged.
