= text-hyphen

== Description

Text::Hyphen is a Ruby library to hyphenate words in various languages using
Ruby-fied versions of TeX hyphenation patterns. It will properly hyphenate
various words according to the rules of the language the word is written in.
The algorithm is based on that of the TeX typesetting system by Donald E.
Knuth.

This is originally based on the Perl implementation of
{TeX::Hyphen}[http://search.cpan.org/author/JANPAZ/TeX-Hyphen-0.140/lib/TeX/Hyphen.pm]
and the {Ruby port}[http://rubyforge.org/projects/text-format]. The language
hyphenation pattern files are based on the sources available from
{CTAN}[http://www.ctan.org] as of 2004.12.19 and have been manually translated
by Austin Ziegler.

This is a minor release fixing documentation errors. This release provides both
Ruby 1.8.7 and Ruby 1.9.2 support. This is the last major release supporting
Ruby 1.8 interpreters. Future versions will only work with Ruby 1.9 or later
interpreters.

== Synopsis

  require 'text/hyphen'
  hh = Text::Hyphen.new(:language => 'en_us', :left => 2, :right => 2)
  # Defaults to the above
  hh = Text::Hyphen.new

  word = "representation"
  points = hh.hyphenate(word)  #=> [3, 5, 8, 10]
  puts hh.visualize(word)      #=> rep-re-sen-ta-tion

Both visualize and hyphenate_to methods allow choosing a custom hyphen:

  puts hh.visualize(word, "&shy;") #=> rep&shy;re&shy;sen&shy;ta&shy;tion


Text::Hyphen is truly multilingual, with 29 languages or language variants
supported. As an example, consider the difference between the following:

  require 'text/hyphen'
  # Using left and right minimum values of 0 ensures that you will see all
  # possible hyphenation points, not just those that meet the minimum width
  # requirements.
  en = Text::Hyphen.new(:left => 0, :right => 0)
  fr = Text::Hyphen.new(:language => "fr", :left => 0, :right => 0)

  puts en.visualise("organiser")      #=> or-gan-iser
  puts fr.visualise("organiser")      #=> or-ga-ni-ser

As you can see, the hyphenation is distinct between the two hyphenators.
Additional improvements over TeX::Hyphen include thread safety (except for
debug control) and support for UTF-8 under Ruby 1.9.
