# Hyphenation patterns for Basque.
# This file has been written by Juan M. Aguirregabiria (wtpagagj@lg.ehu.es)
# on February 1997 and is based on the shyphen.sh script that generates the
# Spanish patterns as compiled by Julio Sanchez (jsanchez@gmv.es) on
# September 1991. The original Copyright follows and applies also to this
# file whose last version will be always available by anonymous ftp from

#
# Hyphenation patterns for Spanish.
# Compiled by Julio Sanchez (jsanchez@gmv.es) on September 1991. These
# patterns have been derived from "On Word Division in Spanish", Jos'e A.
# Ma~nas, Communications of the ACM, and implemented in his package ftc. You
# can get ftc and a draft of the abovementioned paper from goya.dit.upm.es
# in src/text.proc/ftc.Z. FTP access may be available. Otherwise, send help
# to info@goya.dit.upm.es for details on use of the mail server.
#
# Rules mentioned below are those described in that paper. After several
# unsatisfactory attempts to pretend I knew better, these patterns closely
# follow that paper. Pattern 'tl' is not considered. It is conflictive and
# ftc does not use it either.
#
# These patterns have been generated by shyphen.sh version 1.0, shyphen.sh
# is a sh script that allows a number of choices. Full benefit from some of
# these options can only be obtained if appropriate fonts are available.
#
# Follows a copyright notice. This is not in the public domain, but the
# copyright is essentially a hold-harmless clause. That is, use it at will,
# but don't sue me if you don't like it.

# Options included in this set: basic
# Open vowels: a e o
# Closed vowels: i u
# Consonants: b c d f g j k l m n p q r s t v w x y z
#
# Some of the patterns below represent combinations that never happen in
# Basque. Would they happen, they would be hyphenated according to the
# rules.
#
# This keeps {cat|lc}code changes, if any, local. Nice to users of
# multilingual versions. These are the minimum changes needed to process the
# patterns. These and other changes will have to be re-enacted when Basque
# be established as the current language. See the babel docs if you don't
# understand this.
